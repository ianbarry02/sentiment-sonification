# About This Repository
This repository contains 3 files:

1) A Python script that uses Whisper to transcribe a TV episode and saves the transcription as a text file
2) A Python script that uses Python's NLTK to tokenize each sentence in the transcription text file, assign a sentiment score to those sentences, and calculate the difference between the score of one sentence and the previous sentence (all then stored as a CSV)
3) A Python script modified from Matt Russo's data sonification tutorials (https://youtu.be/DUdLRy8i9qI?si=eXDV4-gPaEE7uYKp) that maps the data from the second script onto music notes and produces a MIDI file from that data
